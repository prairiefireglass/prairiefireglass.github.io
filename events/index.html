      There&rsquo;s almost always something happening at PFG! We offer <a href="#classes">glassblowing classes</a> at the studio year-round, and <a href="#ornaments">ornament sessions</a> for small groups around the holidays. In the spring and summer, Jim takes the glass on the road to regional art festivals (mostly in Illinois). We also occasionally host special events or <a href="#demos">group demonstrations</a> by appointment.

    <h2>Group Tours and Demonstrations (September through May)</h2>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;re happy to offer group tours of our gallery and glassblowing space, including live demonstrations. We&rsquo;ll teach your group about the equipment, tools, and skills needed to perform this age-old art. <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> to schedule a tour or to arrange for a special demonstration.
    </p>

    <h2>Ornament Sessions (October through April)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ages 5+</li>
      <li>$20 per ornament (minimum of 8)</li>
      <li>Approximately 1-1.5 hours for 8 ornaments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Guaranteed fun for all ages! You pick the colors and provide the air, and we do the rest. Great for individuals, families, scout, church, and school groups who want to experience glassblowing. Make them for yourself or to give as gifts. We also carry a large assortment of ornament holders so you can display and enjoy your keepsake ornaments throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please <a href="/contact/">call in advance</a> to schedule an appointment — we’ll make every effort to arrange a session time to fit your needs. A deposit or credit card number is required to reserve a time. (Note: the ornaments will need to cool down and will be ready to pick up in 48 hours. Well worth the wait!)
    </p>
