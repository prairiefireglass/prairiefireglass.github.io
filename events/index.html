       In the spring and summer, Jim takes the glass on the road to regional art festivals (mostly in Illinois.) We also host <a href="#demos">events at the studio</a> year-round, including glassblowing classes, ornament sessions, and group demonstrations.

      Please <a href="/contact/">call in advance</a> to schedule an appointment — we’ll make every effort to arrange a session time to fit your needs. A deposit or credit card number is required to reserve a time. (Note: the ornaments will need to cool down and will be ready to pick up in 48 hours. Well worth the wait!)
