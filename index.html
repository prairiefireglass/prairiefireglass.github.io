      Over the last 10 years, Jim has created thousands of beautiful and functional glass works like vases, bowls, paperweights, and ornaments — and exhibited his award-winning work across the Midwest at galleries and regional art festivals.

      When you visit the gallery, you can watch live glassblowing demos in the back of the building, while you browse the finished wares in the front! Along with our handmade glass, we stock mixed-media work from local artists — you’ll find everything from greeting cards to paintings, jewelry, and photography.

      Prairie Fire Glass is a family-run small business. We’re proud to be one of the wonderfully eclectic restaurants and shops in downtown Monticello, Illinois. Monticello’s a hidden gem that’s a great place to visit, and it’s just a 30 minute drive from Champaign. [Come on by] and spend the morning at PFG, eat a tasty lunch across the street at the [Brown Bag], and go for a long walk outside at historic [Allerton Park]. We’d love to see you!

      But if you can’t make it to Monticello in person, no problem. You can order directly from our [online Etsy shop], or [check the schedule] and see if Jim’s coming to a town near you soon.
