      Jim specializes in beautiful and functional objects like vases, bowls, and ornaments — all handmade on site. With a wide range of sizes and styles, we have something for everyone! (And if you can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re looking for, we take <a href="#">custom orders</a> too.)

      When you visit the gallery, you can watch live glassblowing demos in the back of the building, while you browse the finished works in the front. Along with our handmade glass, we stock mixed-media work from local artists — you’ll find everything from greeting cards to paintings, jewelry, and photography.

      Prairie Fire Glass is a family-run small business. We’re proud to be one of the wonderfully eclectic restaurants and shops in downtown Monticello, Illinois. Monticello’s a hidden gem that’s a great place to visit, and it’s just a 30 minute drive from Champaign. [Come on by] and spend the morning at PFG, eat a tasty lunch across the street at the [Brown Bag], and go for a long walk outside at historic [Allerton Park]. We’d love to see you!

      But if you can’t make it to Monticello in person, no problem. You can order directly from our [Etsy shop]! In the warmer months, Jim also tours the Midwest at regional art fairs. [Check the schedule] to see if PFG is coming to a town near you.
