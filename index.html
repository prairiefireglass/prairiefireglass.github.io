      Jim creates beautiful and functional glass works like vases, bowls, jewelry, and ornaments. Each piece is one of a kind and made by hand! We have a wide range of sizes and styles, but if you can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re looking for, we take <a href="shop#custom">custom orders</a> too. Here are a few recent works:

    <p class="cta">
      <a href="shop/" class="cta-button">Check out what's new in the shop &rarr;</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you <a href="visit/">visit the gallery</a>, you can often watch live glassblowing demos in the back of the building, while you browse the finished works in the front. Along with our handmade glass, we stock mixed-media work from local artists. You’ll find everything from greeting cards to paintings, sculpture, and photography.

      Prairie Fire Glass is a family-run small business, and we’re proud to be one of the eclectic restaurants and shops in downtown Monticello, Illinois. Monticello’s a hidden gem that’s a great place to visit. It’s just a 30-minute drive from Champaign! Come on by and spend the morning with us, eat a tasty lunch across the street at the <a href="http://www.monticellobrownbag.com/">Brown Bag</a>, and go for an afternoon walk outside at historic <a href="http://allerton.illinois.edu/">Allerton Park</a>.

      If you can’t make it to Monticello, no problem. You can <a href="shop/">order direct</a> and we&rsquo;ll ship your items in just a few days. In the warmer months, Jim also tours the Midwest at regional art fairs. <a href="shows/">Check the schedule</a> to see if we&rsquo;re coming to a town near you.
