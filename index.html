      Our studio has a unique setup, with a gallery in the front of the building and our live workshop in the back. When you <a href="visit/">visit in person</a>, you can watch live glassblowing demos while browsing our many finished works.

      Prairie Fire Glass is a family-run small business, and we’re proud to be one of the eclectic restaurants and shops in downtown Monticello. Monticello’s a hidden gem that’s a great place to visit, but if you can’t make it in person, no problem! You can <a href="shop/">order direct</a> instead and we&rsquo;ll ship your items in just a few days.

      In the warmer months, Jim takes his glass on the road to several regional Midwest art fairs. <a href="shows/">Check the schedule</a> to see if we&rsquo;re coming to a town near you.
