      Our unique retail store has a gallery in the front and a working studio in the back, so when you <a href="visit/">visit in person</a>, you can watch live glassblowing demos while browsing the extensive variety of finished pieces.

    <p>
      Along with the glass, we stock mixed-media work from local artists — you’ll find everything from greeting cards to paintings, sculpture, and photography.
