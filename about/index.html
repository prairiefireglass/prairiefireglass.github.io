    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A brief history: early years and humble beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      Prairie Fire Glass opened its doors in 2002, but its roots began years earlier when Jim first discovered his interest in stained glass. He studied Fine Arts — including painting, printmaking, and sculpture — at Western Illinois University from 1973-1978. From 1983-2001 he brought his creativity and teaching abilities to Kinko’s, Inc. as a manager and training director. During those years, Jim developed a strong affinity for stained glass in his spare time, resulting in more than 20 elaborate and narrative windows (several of which are now on display in the PFG gallery.)

      In 1998, Jim first discovered his love for glassblowing at the University of Illinois, and he decided to pursue it as a full-time artist shortly thereafter. Since opening in 2002, Prairie Fire Glass has become our&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s best work, and we&rsquo;ve enjoyed these years of sharing it with our wonderful customers and friends.

      We&rsquo;re lucky to have the support of our amazing family. You&rsquo;ll often see Jim&rsquo;s wife Laurie at the store designing our beautiful displays. We&rsquo;ve got handmade furniture from Jim&rsquo;s brother Tim, and handmade signs from his sister-in-law Karla. This very website was created by his son <a href="http://jonas.do">Jonas</a>.

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Artist statment</h2>
    <p>Essentially, I just like making things. I’ve always liked making things. Out of wood, cardboard, metal, stuff I found around that had no particular use or purpose. I just like to make things.</p>
    <p>I don’t wait to get hit by lightning. It’s rare that I have an idea for a finished piece, but more often, a general “direction”, inspired mostly by color relationships. Inspiration can come from sunsets, landscapes and flowers on the side of the road, to native weavings and images generated by the Hubble telescope. With glass, creativity is inherent in the process. The “what if’s” are the catalyst for sometimes small, and sometimes large changes. It’s the changes and evolution in the process that lead to new doors and hallways, that in turn lead to other doors and other hallways. I prefer to make vessels. There is something primal about a simple, functional form that seems to fit with the long history and origins of glassblowing.</p>
    <p>Glass is a unique material. In all different forms, it has a distinct character, temperament and personality that requires technical discipline and process orientation, but still allows for endless spontaneity. I have worked with glass for over 30 years, first with stained glass, and for the last 16 years, as a glass blower. At 42, I took my first glassblowing glass, and found my "bliss". I feel most fortunate to have stumbled across a material and process that provides such an endless variety of applications that so perfectly suit my creative process.</p>
