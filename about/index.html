    <p>Essentially, I just like making things. I’ve always liked making things. Out of wood, cardboard, metal, stuff I found around that had no particular use or purpose. I just like to make things.</p>
    <p>I don’t wait to get hit by lightning. It’s rare that I have an idea for a finished piece, but more often, a general “direction”, inspired mostly by color relationships. Inspiration can come from sunsets, landscapes and flowers on the side of the road, to native weavings and images generated by the Hubble telescope. With glass, creativity is inherent in the process. The “what if’s” are the catalyst for sometimes small, and sometimes large changes. It’s the changes and evolution in the process that lead to new doors and hallways, that in turn lead to other doors and other hallways. I prefer to make vessels. There is something primal about a simple, functional form that seems to fit with the long history and origins of glassblowing.</p>
    <p>Glass is a unique material. In all different forms, it has a distinct character, temperament and personality that requires technical discipline & process orientation, but still allows for endless spontaneity. I have worked with glass for over 30 years, first with stained glass, and for the last 16 years, as a glass blower. At 42, I took my first glassblowing glass, and found my "bliss". I feel most fortunate to have stumbled across a material and process that provides such an endless variety of applications that so perfectly suit my creative process.</p>
