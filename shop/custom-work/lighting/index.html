    <h1>Custom Lighting</h1>
    <p>
      Looking for a pop of color over the island in your kitchen? Perhaps some unique lighting for an entryway or special area behind the bar?
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom lighting can add color and style to existing light fixtures in your home, or add a unique touch to new construction or remodels. You can choose from any of our existing designs, or we can create a custom design to best complement your decor. We’ll work together on the color, size and shape that’s best for your space.

    <h2>
      How do I know if I can replace the shades on my existing fixtures?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways that shades attach to the fixture, either with small thumbscrews or with a threaded collar and large nut.
      If your fixture has the shade attached with the threaded collar and nut, I can make a shade to fit.
      If you’re doing a remodel, or new construction and we can talk early enough in the process, we’ll choose a fixture that fits your requirements, and I’ll make shades for them.
