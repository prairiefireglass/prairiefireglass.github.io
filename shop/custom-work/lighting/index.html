    <h1>Custom Lighting</h1>
    <p>
      Looking for a pop of color over the island in your kitchen? Perhaps some unique lighting for an entryway or special area behind the bar?
    </p>
    <p>
      Custom lighting can add color and style to existing light fixtures in your home, or add a unique touch to new construction or remodels. You can choose from any of our existing designs, or we can create a custom design to best complement your decor. We’ll work together on the color, size and shape that’s best for your space.

    <h2>
      How do I know if I can replace the shades on my existing fixtures?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two ways that glass shades can attach to a light fixture: either with small thumbscrews, or with a threaded collar and nut. If your fixture has the threaded collar, we can make a shade to fit.
    </p>
    <h2>How do we get started?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="/contact/">Email or call us</a> at the studio, and we’ll schedule a time to discuss the creation process: what to make, color design, and pricing.
